# Ruby's array and hashes are indexed collections. Both store collections of
# objects, accessible using a key. With arrays, the key is an integer, whereas
# hashes support any object as a key. Both arrays and hashes groe as needed to
# provide more flexibility. It's more efficient to access array elements, but
# hashes provide more flexibility. Any particular array or hash can
# hold objects of differing types; you can have an array containing an
# integer, a string, and a floating point number, as we'll see in a minute.
