# Ruby uses a convention to help it distinguish the usage of a name:
# the first characters of a name indicate how the name is used.
# - Local variables, method parameters, and method names should all start with
#   a lowercase letter or with an underscore.
# - Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign ($), while instance
#   variables begin with an ``at''(@).
# - Class variables start with two ``at'' signs (@@).
