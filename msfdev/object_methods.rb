Rex::Socket.methods
Rex::Socket#methods

# Within the text, Fred#doIt is a reference to an instance method (doIt) of
# class, while Fred.new [In some other Ruby documentation, you may see class
# methods written as Fred::new. This is perfectly valid Ruby syntax; we just
# happen to feel that Fred.new is less distracting to read.] is a class
# method, and Fred::EOF is a class constant.
